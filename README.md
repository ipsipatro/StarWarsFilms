# StarWarsFilms
Shows list of Star wars films, on tap of a film app will show list of characters

## Getting Started
After cloning the project, first install pods and then select on the .xcworkspace file to open the project in xcode to run the app.

I have created this project using Xcode 14.3 and Swift 5. These are the main functionalities of the app:

# App functionality
1: Fetch list of Star wars films using an API call and show them in a list
2: On tap of a film it will show all the characters of the film
3: Persisting films to supprot offline mode.

#  Todo:
If I could spend more time on this project these are the points I could improve:
1: Improve the UI 
2: Persist characters
3: Add more unit testing
